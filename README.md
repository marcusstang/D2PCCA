## Abstract
This paper presents Deep Dynamic Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (D$^2$PCCA), a model that integrates deep learning with probabilistic modeling to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems. Building on the probabilistic extensions of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), D$^2$PCCA captures nonlinear latent dynamics and supports enhancements such as KL annealing for improved convergence and normalizing flows for a more flexible posterior approximation. D$^2$PCCA naturally extends to multiple observed variables, making it a versatile tool for encoding prior knowledge about sequential datasets and providing a probabilistic understanding of the systemâ€™s dynamics. Experimental validation on real financial datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of D$^2$PCCA and its extensions in capturing latent dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Nonlinear Latent Dynamics Modeling**: Captures complex temporal dependencies among multiple observed variables.
- **Flexible Posterior Approximation**: Employs normalizing flows to handle multimodal posterior distributions.
- **Versatile Application**: Suitable for various sequential datasets, including financial data, speech signals, and other multivariate time-series data.
